</h4>
            <p>
                The research centers at Jain (Deemed-to-be University) focus on finding solutions to disruptive interdisciplinary /
                cross-disciplinary research problems that will
                have a significant societal and/or economic impact. Through its extensive network of highly skilled research faculty and
                scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral
                fellows and collaborators, the University is working towards advancing research by funding growth, creating unique
                research training opportunities, and increasing
                its competitiveness for externally funded program project and grants.

            <h4>Promotion of Research</h4>
            <p>
                A Research Development Cell (RDC) has been established with the Vice Chancellor as the Chairman and the Pro Vice
                Chancellors, the Deans of Faculty, Directors of
                the Research Centers, and eminent experts as members. The RDC oversees the research activities undertaken at the
                University level. The RDC has created Research
                Development Units (RDU) in each faculty. The RDUs are headed by the concerned deans and consists of all heads of
                departments in the faculty, professors,
                and external experts in the chosen research domain. The RDC also oversees the Ph.D. and M.Phil. programs of the
                University and coordinates the activities of the
                research centers. The major and minor research projects that are proposed by the faculty are scrutinized by the
                concerned RDUs and subsequently, approved by
                the RDC and forwarded to the concerned sponsoring agencies. In-house projects are reviewed by the RDUs and recommended
                to the RDC for approval.
                The University sets aside a portion of its budget for such in-house research projects. The approved project coordinators
                are required to submit biannual reports
                to the concerned RDUs. The RDC conducts workshops and seminars on research methods at regular intervals for faculty and
                research students.

            Wi-Fi, online journals, e-books, and international
            and national journals. Out of mutual interest, research institutes like IISc, RRI, NAL, and CSIR have extended their
            facility to Jain (Deemed-to-be University).<br><br>
            The postgraduate department laboratories are equipped with the most advanced equipment to suit additional academic and
            research needs of students pursuing
            their masters, M.Phil, and Ph.D. degrees. The undergraduate labs are well equipped to carry out minor research projects.
            The University also has a well-resourced
            library, internet, computers in every department, and audio-visual facility to pursue research. To help our researcher,
            we also have the following:
